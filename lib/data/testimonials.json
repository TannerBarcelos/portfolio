This class was on full stack web development which includes development for the front end, backend, and the network (protocols and architectures). Tanner excelled at Website design, React, and Node.js development. As an undergraduate he then took my graduate level CS651 Web Systems class where he was my top student. This class featured enhanced web security, server testing (via JavaScript testing frameworks), enhanced JSON processing including JSON-Schema based validation and WebSockets.Tanner went significantly beyond class requirements with his own development project (web app) which featured independent deployment, API usage, enhanced CSS techniques, etc. In addition, Tanner has very good communication skills. I highly recommend Tanner for any type of web related development job",
